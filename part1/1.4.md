Curl can be installed when creating the container by running the following
```bash
docker run -d --rm -it --name curlwebsite ubuntu sh -c 'apt-get update; apt-get install curl -y; echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$
website;' 
```
When we attach to the container, curl will be installed first and after that the original process asking for user to input the website will run
```bash
docker attach curlwebsite
```
